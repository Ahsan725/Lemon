## Project Architecture

The user interaction flow starts with the home page, serving as an introduction to the restaurant. A navigation bar is available on all pages. The order section of this navigation bar prompts the user to log in or navigate to the Sign Up page if they don't have an account. Both client-side and server-side validation are implemented for signup and login pages.

The user journey involves:
- Registration and login
- Order selection and cart management
- Generating an order summary
- Submitting an order

## User Interface (UI) Design

- Global CSS styles
- Font family: Optima for modern and simple aesthetics
- Pastel-colored theme for a laid-back feel
- Bubbly, rounded buttons with hover effects
- Linear gradient backgrounds
- Subtle animations for user feedback
- Alternate color-coded tables for improved visibility

## Database Design

The database used is a MySQL table with three columns: full name, email address, and password.

## Functionality & Features

- Navigation
- Order Page
- Checkout Cart
- Order Summary
- Checkout Timer (15 minutes)
- User-friendly interactions
- Clear feedback and error handling

## Technology Stack

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

Backend:
- PHP
- MySQL (Database Management)

## Challenges & Mitigation

The main challenge faced was setting up the backend, especially for someone new to back-end programming. The key learning was to establish the database connection first and then debug the code systematically. This experience was invaluable for improving development skills and problem-solving abilities.
